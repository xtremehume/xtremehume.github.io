There has been a lot of noise around this fork and I wanted to offer my view in an effort to separate FUD from legitimate criticism (TL;DR btg team sucks at comms but they are not scammers):

 1. The BTG team have done a bad job of communications. They've let tons of negative surprises spiral out of control without controlling the narrative and clarifying missteps in the project.

 2. That said, the team is not malicious or scammers: they have been working on this fork for a long time and are seriously motivated by the creation of a competing Bitcoin chain that distributes hash power more democratically via equihash

 3. The pre-mine for devs was stated before launch, so this should not come as a surprise. Small amt to compensate developers thus far, majority in time locked wallet to finance dev team operations without relying on external capital going fwd. That feels fair to me.

  3a. However, the pre-mine rationale was not clearly communicated and promoted, nor was founded and unfounded criticism quickly addressed, so they allowed this narrative of a "surprise premine" to spiral

 4. StarbuckBG "hidden" mining pool fee: Poor internal controls and poor external communications. My view on this was Martin felt the 0.5% reward was more than fair for his blood sweat and tears in the project, and that the code is open source so should be obvious. Not malicious - I mean it's available for anyone to see, by definition not hidden. But when he was criticised, he responded with defensiveness, making the situation worse.

  4a. I think Martin (and prob the whole team) had been feeling underresourced, undercompensated, and underappreciated. Fair, but also that is no excuse for poor team management and external comms. Leaders should have taken a better pulse on team morale and should have a strategy in place for external communications.

 5. There are a lot of powerful forces that want BTG to fail. This is not the fault of the BTG team at all. DDOS attacks, mining pool attacks, malicious wallets (one that even got itself listed on the BTG official site, then turned out to be scam - since removed). They have been spreading sophisticated and coordinated FUD. My guess: ASIC miner community. Those guys are mercenary and this is not above them. But that's just speculation.
